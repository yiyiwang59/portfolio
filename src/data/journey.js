    description: 'Started at Fusion Risk Management building on Salesforce, where I discovered my love for architecting data solutions that actually solve business problems.',
    fullStory: 'My journey at Fusion Risk Management was where I first discovered my passion for technical problem-solving. As a Salesforce Administrator, I was responsible for managing our CRM system and ensuring data integrity across multiple business units.\n\nWhat started as basic configuration work quickly evolved into complex data architecture challenges. I found myself diving deep into Salesforce\'s technical capabilities, building custom objects, workflows, and integrations that streamlined our risk management processes.\n\nThe turning point came when I was tasked with integrating our Salesforce org with multiple third-party risk assessment tools. This project required me to learn about APIs, data modeling, and system architecture - concepts that would become the foundation of my technical career.\n\nWorking closely with our engineering team, I gained exposure to software development practices and began to see how technology could be leveraged to solve complex business problems. This experience planted the seeds for my eventual transition into engineering.'

    description: 'Joined the technical services team at Salesloft, where I specialized in building integrations, internal data tools, and custom salesforce solutions. It was here where my long-term career goal of becoming an engineer was fully realized.',
    fullStory: 'At Salesloft, I joined the Technical Services team as a Senior Solutions Engineer, where my role was to bridge the gap between our product capabilities and complex customer requirements.\n\nMy primary focus was on building custom integrations and data solutions for enterprise customers. This involved working with REST APIs, webhook architectures, and complex data transformations. I became proficient in JavaScript, Python, and SQL while building tools that helped our largest customers maximize their investment in our platform.\n\nOne of my most impactful projects was developing an internal data pipeline that automated customer onboarding processes, reducing setup time from weeks to days. This project required me to work closely with our engineering team, participate in code reviews, and follow proper software development practices.\n\nThe technical challenges at Salesloft confirmed my passion for engineering and gave me the confidence to pursue a full transition into software development. I realized that I thrived when solving complex technical problems and building scalable solutions.'

    description: 'The direction of my role was shifting away from custom technical solutions and towards consulting for out-of-box products. Ultimately, my specialized role on the team was no longer aligned with the needs of the business or my long term career goals.',
    fullStory: 'As Salesloft matured as a company, the business strategy began to shift towards promoting standardized, out-of-the-box solutions rather than custom technical implementations. While this made business sense from a scalability perspective, it meant moving away from the technical problem-solving work that I was most passionate about.\n\nI found myself spending more time on consultative calls and less time building. The role was evolving from a technical solutions engineer to more of a product consultant, which didn\'t align with my goal of deepening my technical skills.\n\nThis misalignment became a catalyst for self-reflection. I realized that I wanted to be closer to the product development process - building the solutions rather than just implementing them. I wanted to write code, design systems, and solve complex engineering challenges.\n\nThe decision to leave wasn\'t easy, but it was necessary for my career growth. I knew that to become the engineer I wanted to be, I needed to take a step back and invest in building a stronger technical foundation.'

    description: 'Enrolled in Georgia Tech OMSA, self-studied Harvard\'s CS50, worked on personal projects to deepen my understanding of data engineering and web development.',
    fullStory: 'After leaving Salesloft, I made the decision to invest fully in my technical education. I enrolled in Georgia Tech\'s Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA) program to deepen my understanding of data science and machine learning.\n\nConcurrently, I completed Harvard\'s CS50 course to strengthen my computer science fundamentals. The course covered everything from basic algorithms and data structures to web development with Python, JavaScript, and SQL. This gave me a solid foundation in programming principles and software engineering practices.\n\nI\'ve been building a portfolio of projects that showcase my skills in data engineering and web development. These projects range from ETL pipelines and data visualization dashboards to full-stack web applications. Each project teaches me something new and helps me apply the concepts I\'ve learned in a practical context.\n\nThis journey has been challenging but incredibly rewarding. I\'m building the technical skills I need while maintaining the business acumen from my previous roles. My goal is to become a well-rounded engineer who can bridge the gap between technical implementation and business value.\n\nThe combination of formal education, self-study, and hands-on projects is preparing me for the next chapter of my career as a data engineer or full-stack developer.'
