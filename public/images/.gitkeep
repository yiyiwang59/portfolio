# Image Upload Instructions

## Quick Setup - Just drop your images here!

Replace these files with your own:

1. **profile_pic.jpeg** - Your profile photo (recommended: 400x400px, square)
2. **banner.jpeg** - Hero section background (recommended: 1920x600px, landscape)

The website will automatically use these images once you upload them.

## File Requirements:
- **Format**: JPEG (.jpeg or .jpg)
- **Profile Picture**: Square aspect ratio works best (400x400px recommended)
- **Banner**: Wide landscape format (1920x600px recommended)
- **Size**: Keep under 2MB for fast loading

## How to Upload:
1. Navigate to `public/images/` folder
2. Delete existing files (if any)
3. Add your new images with exact names:
   - `profile_pic.jpeg` (or `profile_pic.jpg`)
   - `banner.jpeg` (or `banner.jpg`)
4. Refresh your browser - images will update automatically!

No code changes needed - the system handles everything automatically.
