            <div className="prose text-gray-600 space-y-4">
              <p>
                With my background in psychology and consulting, to now switching gears to a more technical path, 
                I bring a unique perspective to problem-solving and a deep understanding of user needs. So much of my work thus far
                has been about understanding the 'why' behind user requirements and translating that into technical solutions. That being said, 
                my greatest strengths and competencies have continuously circled back to my technical and analytical prowess. I make sense of 
                the world around me by creating structures and categories and relating them together, in other words, 
                through data schemas. Then designing systems and processes to efficiently manage and operationalize that data into useful tools and insights. For example, 
                I use Notion as a relational database to organize my life and turn my tasks and projects into a structured system that I can easily navigate and manage, including 
                creating learning plans, tracking kitchen inventory for automated recipe management, and managing chore cadences. It borders on excessive, but it's what flows naturally for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                At this point in my career, I am focused on honing my skills as a data engineer and learning the best practices and industry standards 
                when it comes to building robust and efficient data infrastructures while also learning the nuances of different approaches to building data pipelines through 
                witnessing new technologies and methodologies in action. I'm looking to surround myself with experienced mentors and learning to work collaboratively in a fast-paced environment. Eventually, I am looking to 
                build a strong foundation in data engineering and transition into a more specialized role in data architecture or machine learning engineering through hands-on, applied
                experience professionally, but also through academic projects and coursework in my master's program. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Something you should know about me is that I am a constant revolving cycle of hyperfixations. 
                When I discover a new hobby or interest whether it's broadway shows, new artists, book genres, movies, 
                TV shows/anime, extracurricular clubs, sports, skills, or even an app like Notion, I dive as deep as I can possibly go. At the core, 
                I love building my proficiency in new skills through dedication and practice which in turn opens my mind to appreciating
                the intricacies of mastering a craft. This focus and mindset is what I take with me in all aspects of my life including 
                my career as an engineer.
