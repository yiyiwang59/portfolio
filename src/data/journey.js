    description: 'Started at Fusion Risk Management building on Salesforce, where I discovered my love for architecting data solutions that actually solve business problems.',
    fullStory: 'Fresh out of college with a psychology degree, I landed at Fusion Risk Management as an Implementation Consultant. The job was to help clients configure their complex, custom business continuity and risk management processes on a robust, powerful platform, Salesforce. This was where I started to discover that satisfying feeling of technical solutioning. One project still stands out: I built a complex automation flow managing three lookup fields across multiple related objects, keeping data synced no matter where it was updated. The user experience was dead simple - click a button, data flows everywhere it needs to be. But behind that simplicity was a symphony of processes I\'d orchestrated, accounting for every edge case. That\'s when I knew - I loved building things where the complexity was abstracted away, where my technical work made someone else\'s job effortless. Every time I delivered exactly what a client envisioned, watching their face light up when they saw their messy Excel process transformed into an elegant Salesforce solution, that was what fueled me during those late nights working overtime. My psychology degree wasn\'t wasted - it made me better at understanding what clients actually needed versus what they said they wanted. I could ask the right questions, get to the real pain points, and deliver solutions that felt like mind-reading. \n\nMy first exposure to the ETL process came when a client was manually processing public disaster data in Excel to create annual reports. I took their raw data source, designed a schema to capture it properly, and built a transformation script that converted everything into Salesforce-ready formats. The thrill of taking chaos and turning it into order, of solving real business problems with code I\'d written. When I hit limitations with flows, I learned Apex. When I mastered Apex, I wondered what I could build outside Salesforce. The seeds were planted. I wasn\'t just a consultant who could configure software. I was someone who craved the power to build any solution I envision.'

    description: 'Joined the technical services team at Salesloft, where I specialized in building integrations, internal data tools, and custom salesforce solutions. It was here where my long-term career goal of becoming an engineer was fully realized.',
    fullStory: 'Salesloft was supposed to be a step up. Bigger company, better title, more technical work. Unfortunately, it became a lesson. Unlike Fusion, where I built on Salesforce\'s robust platform, Salesloft was its own rigid software that merely integrated with Salesforce. Clients would ask for simple things - filter by a field, use a "contains" operator, sync a custom object - and all I could say was "we\'ll put it on the product roadmap." The role became less about building solutions to match client\'s needs and more about convincing the client to adopt our software out-of-box, despite their needs. \n\nI tried to find ways to stay technical. I dove deep into our internal Google Apps Script tools for data migrations, building features to handle new API objects. I tried to learn all about integrations and best practices around keeping clean and accurate data with bidirectional syncs. When a client needed to eliminate 3 million duplicate records from 13 million total, I wrote a Python script with a seven-layer decision tree to determine which duplicates to keep. Running that simulation, getting client approval, then watching it successfully clean their entire database - that was a glimpse of real engineering. \n\nThe breaking point came when they shifted even further from technical solutions toward pure consulting. It was clear after 2 years in the role, I had tried my best to make the best of it, learned what I could, but ultimately, this was a role that highlighted my weaknesses and silenced my strengths, and that ate away at my sense of self for a while.'

    description: 'The direction of my role was shifting away from custom technical solutions and towards consulting for out-of-box products. Ultimately, my specialized role on the team was no longer aligned with the needs of the business or my long term career goals.',
    fullStory: 'The breaking point came when they shifted even further from technical solutions toward pure consulting. It was clear after 2 years in the role, I had tried my best to make the best of it, learned what I could, but ultimately, this was a role that highlighted my weaknesses and silenced my strengths, and that ate away at my sense of self for a while. Parting ways wasnâ€™t easy, but for the first time in my life, I was taking a leap of faith, betting entirely on myself. I\'d already built my beta Mochi flashcards project while struggling at Salesloft, and that tiny taste of building something real - something that solved my own problem - was intoxicating. It proved I could figure out programming on my own. I could build things that worked. However, I\'m not naive to the fact that the timing couldn\'t have been worse. 2024 - tech layoffs everywhere, AI disrupting everything, the worst possible moment to break into software engineering. I was betting on myself with the worst possible odds. But looking at my five years of experience, the pattern was undeniable. Every moment of fulfillment came from building: the guided workflows at Fusion, the custom risk app, the data transformations. Every moment of misery came from being limited, from having to talk instead of build, from knowing the technical solution but being unable to implement it.'

    description: 'Enrolled in Georgia Tech OMSA, self-studied Harvard\'s CS50, worked on personal projects to deepen my understanding of data engineering and web development.',
    fullStory: 'Originally, I had set my sights on data engineering since that aligned more with my previous experience and it captured my niche interest in building data schemas and systems. I was advised to not tunnel myself into one area early on, because all software engineers can do what data engineers do. So I\'d learn the foundations first, understand the whole landscape, then specialize. CS50 came up repeatedly in my research. The professor was phenomenal, the lectures cinematic, the assignments brutal but satisfying. I committed to only doing the hardest problem sets - if I was betting on myself, I needed to prove I could tackle the toughest challenges. Building Hanzismith as my final project was different from the beta. This wasn\'t just automation - it was a full web application with authentication, a real UI, the exact user experience I\'d envisioned. Every line of code was mine, every design decision deliberate. This project gave me the tools and foundation of full-stack web development, but it also solidified that back-end development and data engineering was indeed where I thrived most.\n\nAn old mentor from Fusion reached out with perfect timing. He was building CareerLauncher and needed someone for the backend - exactly what I wanted to learn. The goal: build a data pipeline to extract job listings from multiple aggregators. I spent seven weeks getting the pipeline working locally, then came deployment. AWS, S3 buckets, MWAA for Airflow orchestration. I\'d never used Airflow but I knew it was essential to data engineering. My first DAG was rough, but it worked. Then came Lambda functions, batch processing, virtual environments. The pipeline now processes 45,000 job listings with an 89% success rate. CommonCrawl to Lambda to S3 to Supabase. Async processing, batch optimization, memory management at scale. \n\nGeorgia Tech OMSA also just started. I\'m taking ISYE6501 for analytics and machine learning foundations, and CS6400 for databases. After five years of designing schemas by intuition, I\'m validating my knowledge with academic rigor. The goal is to eventually transfer to OMSCS, taking overlapping courses to build my case for acceptance. My learning approach is focused and deliberate. I find myself approaching life itself like an engineering problem - breaking things down, finding patterns, building systems that make sense. Being an engineer isn\'t about memorizing every tool or solution. It\'s about developing the skills to learn any tool, tackle any problem.'
